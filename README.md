# BlackDot
 The code creates a black border around an image by first opening the image using the Python Imaging Library (PIL), then it uses the numpy library to create an array representation of the image. It then iterates through the array, checking the pixels on the edge of the image, and replaces the color of those pixels with black. The code also allows you to specify the width of the border in pixels by passing an argument when calling the function. This modified image is then saved as a new image file with the same name as the original image file but with "_bordered" appended to it.
